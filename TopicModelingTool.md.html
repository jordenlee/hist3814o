<p>This was a nope…My Canadian war files didn’t exist in under the assumption and i believe they were saved individually not in a file as i see multiple copies of imgs in the first level.<br>
Went to grab Shawn Grahams from the link provided in the workbood and while it was visible on the web, the format avaiable for saving was not visible by the Topic Modelling Tool to even open the document. however in watching the videos reading over the saved CSV file, I would assume that the program churns through all the files and writing and based on our requirements, extracts 10 different topics. With the 10 Different topics, the files are then grouped based on similarity which can eliminate the time to determine whether some information is important or not. This however does have its downside as some information can be inaccurately categorized and thus get lost and unreported.</p>
