<p>The thing with computers is that it either is, or it isn’t. Computers are very good at reading and executing task that they understand.<br>
With Overview, we can search terms, tag them and search another term with the tag still being there. This can help in the organization of information when done correctly. The problem i would have with this i cannot yet see the value in the amount of work required to clean and prep documents like this.<br>
The reason being, there will be so many tags and so much additional information to read through if we are looking for something specific.<br>
Personally, if i go too many levels deep in my file storage, i can’t find the data ever again. Additionally, people have different definitions of the same word which causes a lot of confusions and in the perspective other person, misfiles and inaccurate tagging.<br>
At the same time, overview enables us to capture focused stories in an efficient manner by eliminating all the irrelevant information to our filters. This is extremely beneficial since if for example, someone decided to search the term banking, we could see all of the contexts in which that term was used, and be able to piece a decent macro or micro story together.</p>
